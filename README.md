Marketing Campaign Performance Dashboard
Built with Power BI & AI-powered Python Script

Project Overview
This project analyzes marketing campaign performance using synthetic data generated with Python and visualized using Power BI.
With AI-supported data creation (using the faker library), the goal was to simulate real-world marketing scenarios and visualize performance metrics in an interactive dashboard.

Objective
To design a marketing analytics dashboard that helps understand:
Campaign-wise performance
Trends across months
Conversion and CTR metrics
High-performing marketing channels

Tools Used
Python (pandas, faker) – For dataset generation
Power BI – For visualization and dashboard creation
OpenPyXL – For Excel file export
Git & GitHub – For version control and sharing
AI (Faker + logic) – To simulate 2000+ rows of meaningful campaign data

Features of Dashboard
Monthly trend of Impressions, Clicks & Conversions
Conversion Funnel
CTR trend over time
Campaign channel filter (Email, Social Media, Google Ads etc.)
Dynamic filter for Campaign Names
Aggregated KPIs with slicers (Year/Month-based)

🤖 How AI Was Used
Used Python + Faker library (AI-based data generation tool) to automatically simulate over 2000+ rows of campaign data with columns like:

Campaign Name
Channel
Impressions
Clicks
Conversions
Start Date
CTR (%)
Cost per Click
Cost per Conversion
This helped build a realistic dataset without needing any real company data.
